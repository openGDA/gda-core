		// So if the user presses 'apply to all' and then switches to the XML editor before saving then the XML is not
		// updated, but if the user saves first then everything is OK.
		
		// Not enough time to fix this bug: but the correct fix is related to the fact that the
		// Xspress3ParametersComposite bean is not the same object as the one held by the DelegatingRichBeanEditorPart
		// and the XML editor.
