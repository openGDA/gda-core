<h2>DAQ Platform Server launcher prototypes</h2>

<p>The uk.ac.diamond.server.feature plugin contains two GDA 9 server launcher prototypes (dummy and live) that are intended to allow 
you to create your own local versions for the beamlines you support, without them all ending up getting checked into git with multiple
variants of the required list of plugins. The prototypes <i>will</i> start the server for the EXAMPLE beamline, but are only intended as 
starting points for creating real beamline launchers. As the set of plugins that define the GDA 9 server evolves they will be kept in 
step so that they can always be used to generate beamline specific launchers for the current build.</p>

<h3>Creating Local Beamline specific launchers</h3>


<p To create a beamline launcher do the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Make a copy of the launcher for the mode you want (dummy or live) either in the Navigator/PackageExplorer or via the Run 
	Configurations dialog.</li>
	<li>Edit the copy  you just made in the Run Configurations dialog giving it an appropriate name and press Apply.</li>
	<li>Select the Environment tab and define the BEAMLINE environment variable with the required value, then press Apply.</li>
	<li>Select the Common tab and set the Save location to Local and press Apply. This will save your version under the workspace folder 
	rather than the workspace_git one, isolating it from git but keeping it part of your local workspace.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can now use your new launcher and modify its settings/plugin content without affecting anyone else. If you do some development that 
will require new plugins to be added to the main product definition, simply add them (or the feature containing them) to the server's feature.xml 
definition and the Core Team will update the launcher prototypes as part of the Gerrit submission review process.</p>
