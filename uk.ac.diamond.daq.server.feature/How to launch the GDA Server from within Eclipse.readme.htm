<h2>Launching the GDA 9+ Server</h2>

<p>The first time you wish to launch the GDA Server after materializing your workspace, it is necessary to generate a launcher with the correct 
dependencies from the uk.ac.diamond.daq.server.product. Open this file and on the Overview tab in the Testing area (bottom left), click 'Synchronize' 
followed by 'Launch and Eclipse application'. This will generate and start a launcher called 'uk.ac.diamond.daq.product' running the example config.
You should then stop this launcher (there doesn't seem to be any way to prevent it starting), find it in the Run Configurations are and then set 
the BEAMLINE and GDA_MODE environment variables to the values you require on the Environment tab. You should also go to the Common tab and set the Save 
Location to Local so that the launcher does not get saved in the workspace-git area.Once you have applied this, you can start the launcher in the normal 
way and it will run the server using your beamline's configuration. </p>

<p>If you need to regenerate the launcher for any reason, you will need to ensure that you delete this launcher before attempting to regenerate 
it as if you don't, Eclipse will see it already exists and ignore you. Once you have done this it is a repeat of the process above. In summary:</p>

<h3>Creating a Local Beamline specific launcher</h3>


<p> To create a beamline launcher do the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Make sure you delete any Run configuration launchers called uk.ac.diamond.daq.server.product.</li>
	<li>From the uk.ac.diamond.daq.server.product editor click 'Synchronize' followed by 'Launch an Eclipse application'.</li>
	<li>Stop the resulting running server (unless you actually want example config) and find the uk.ac.diamond.daq.server.product launcher.</li>
	<li>Select its Environment tab and define the BEAMLINE and GDA_MODE environment variables with the required values (GDA_MODE defaults to dummy), then press Apply.</li>
	<li>Select the Common tab and set the Save location to Local and press Apply. This will save your version under the workspace folder 
	rather than the workspace_git one, isolating it from git but keeping it part of your local workspace.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can now use your new launcher and modify its settings/plugin content without affecting anyone else. If you do some development that 
will require new plugins to be added to the main product definition, simply add them (or the feature containing them) to the server's feature.xml 
definition before committing.</p>
