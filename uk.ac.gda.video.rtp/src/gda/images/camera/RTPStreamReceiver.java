/**
 * Connects to an RTP stream, and runs a capture task at a regular fixed interval that captures frames from the stream
 * at (approximately) the desired frame rate, and passes them to a list of {@link ImageListener}s. By default, the
 * desired frame rate is 25fps.
 * 
 * <p>Configuring the receiver establishes the RTP connection and begins image capture. Image capture can be turned off
 * and on using the {@link #stop()} and {@link #start()} methods.
 * 
 * <p>The entire connection can be terminated using {@link #closeConnection()}, and then started again using
 * {@link #createConnection()} (which will also resume image capture once the connection has been established).
