/**
 * The ExperimentDriver is any apparatus or mechanism that modifies the specimen
 * over time. This can include a mechanical test rig, a furnace, a chemical
 * delivery system, etc.
 * <p>
 * The ExperimentDriver will follow a user-specified profile which may be software-
 * or hardware-driven (i.e. driven by GDA or by some external controller). This
 * profile is generally the process referred to as <i>the experiment</i>, where
 * as scans performed during this time are termed <i>measurements</i>.
 * <p>
 * Additionally, an ExperimentDriver will have a set of readouts which can be used to monitor
 * progress and to trigger GDA/Malcolm measurements (see {@link ISampleEnvironmentVariable}).
 * These readouts need not necessarily be part of the driven hardware, but more generally
 * signals which are affected by the profile. As such, they may need to be calibrated and used
 * as software limits and/or abort conditions.
