/**
 * This interface allows an object to reserve a resource for itself.
 *
 * Having multiple objects are competing for the same resource, this interface allows a controller to restrict some
 * operations only to the object owning the resource. An example could be a controller exposing an instance of this
 * interface so other objects can reserve the controller for them self.
 *
 * As the reservation is done using {@link Object}, can act simply as validator irrespective of the class type, and this
 * is further stressed by the fact that the interface does not directly expose the object which reserved the resource.
