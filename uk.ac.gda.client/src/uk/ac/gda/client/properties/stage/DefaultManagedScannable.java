/**
 * A predefined set of scannable.
 *
 * <p>
 * These definitions help to parametrise the GUI assuming that they are property configured in the client properties configuration.
 * This approach allows to loosely couple the GUI and the scannables but at the same time allows to build a client focused more on
 * the functionality than on a specific implementation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *  An example could be the experimental hutch shutter (EH_SHUTTER) which is an element common to most of the beamlines. Instead of directly binding the client code
 *  with a scannable name, {@link DefaultManagedScannable#EH_SHUTTER}, is an object which express, in the client, a specific functionality which can be
 *  configured in the properties.
