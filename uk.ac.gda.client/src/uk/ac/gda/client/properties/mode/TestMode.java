/**
 * Configures the client execution test mode.
 * <p>
 * The goal of this mode is to filter out from the acquisition request a subset of scannable.
 * One possible use is when the hutch is open; in this case the acquisition the safety inhibits the eh_shutter to be opened
 * and consequently the acquisition fails. Setting a configuraiton like
 * <pre>
 * client.modes.test.active = true
 * client.modes.test.elements[0].device = eh_shutter
 * client.modes.test.elements[0].exclude = true
 * </pre>
 *
 * Allows to execute the acquisition despite no bean is in the hutch.
