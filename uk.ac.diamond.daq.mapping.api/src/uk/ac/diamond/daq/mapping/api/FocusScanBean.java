 * A bean representing a focus scan. The following fields should be configured in spring:
 * <ul>
 * <li><em>focusScannableName</em>: The name of the focus scannable (normally a zone plate);</li>
 * <li><em>Number of focus steps</em>: The default number of focus steps to take in the scan;</li>
 * <li><em>Number of line points</em>: The default number of points in the line to scan. The line is scanned at each
 * focus step.</li>
 * <li><em>(Optionally) Energy/focus configuration bean</em>: A definition of a function coupling energy and focus
 * position, and a file into which this should be serialised</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <em>Note:</em>This bean has a dual purpose, besides describing a particular focus scan, some fields are required to
 * setup focus scanning in general for a beamline.
 * <p>
 * TODO perhaps this bean should be split into two, one to setup focus scanning on a beamline e.g. FocusScanSetupBean,
 * and FocusScanBean only containing the fields necessary to setup a particular scan.
