/**
 * The experiment driver is the thing that defines the experiment from start to finish.
 * This could be e.g. a strain sequence applied to a sample, some acid being dropped
 * into a piece of material and left for a predetermined amount of time, some fibres
 * being pulled until the snap, etc. The driver may be software or hardware-triggered.
 * <p>
 * Any number of scans may be performed during the experiment, but they are referred to
 * as measurements, not the experiment themselves. The collection of measurements need
 * to be logically grouped to reflect this concept.
 * <p>
 * In a fully-automated mode, measurements are software-triggered based on some signal
 * recorded from the experiment driver. This need not necessarily be the same signal
 * which is being driven e.g. in a strain experiment, we may be controlling the displacement
 * of the mechanical rig, but measurements might be triggered by the load across the sample.
