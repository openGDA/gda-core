/**
 * A {@link IJobQueue} holds a queue of beans that represent tasks that can be run, together with
 * a consumer thread that reads beans from the queue, creating and running a process for each
 * according to the process factory that this queue has been configured with. It also contains
 * a set of beans for running and completed tasks. As tasks run, any change in their status
 * is published to the status topic, a JMS topic.
 * <p>
 * A job queue can be thought of a being composed of three components, and each method of this
 * interface is directed at exactly one of these components:
 * <ol>
 *
 * <li><em>The submission queue:</em> A queue of beans defining jobs to be run.
 * The method {@link #getSubmissionQueue()} returns a copy of the queue as a list.
 * A bean can be submitted to the tail of the queue using the {@link #submit(Object)} method.
 * The methods {@link #moveForward(Object)}
 * and {@link #moveBackward(Object)} and {@link #remove(Object)} can be used to move beans
 * up the queue, down the queue and to remove a bean from the queue, respectively.
 * {@link #clearQueue()} removes all beans from the queue</li>
 *
 * <li><em>The consumer thread:</em> A thread that runs in a loop, removing a job bean from
 * the submission queue, creating an {@link IBeanProcess} for it and running it
 * The process is run in the same thread if {@link IBeanProcess#isBlocking()} is <code>true</code>,
 * otherwise it is run in a new thread.
 * The method {@link #setRunner(IProcessCreator)} should be called by the code that
 * creates the job queue to set the {@link IProcessCreator} used to create the processes.
 * The methods {@link #start()}, {@link #stop()}, {@link #pause()}, {@link #resume()}
 * can be used to control the consumer thread.</li>
 * <li><em>The status set:</em> An ordered set of beans for running and completed jobs.
 * The consumer thread adds a bean to this set when it is removed from the submission queue.
 * The method {@link #removeCompleted(Object)} can be used to remove a particular bean
 * from this method</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * When the status of the bean changes, it is published to the status topic, a JMS topic
 * that can be listened to with an {@link ISubscriber}. The name of the status topic is returned by
 * {@link #getStatusTopicName()}. The beans status will change as the job is started and completed.
 * Also, the job queue passes an {@link IPublisher} to the {@link IBeanProcess} that runs
 * the job for the bean so that it can also send notifications to the status topic when necessary.
 * <p>
 * The job queue can also be controlled via a JMS topic called the command topic. The
 * method {@link #getCommandTopicName()} returns the name of this topic, and
 * {@link #getCommandAckTopicName()} the name of the topic used to return responses.
 * The command topic takes {@link QueueCommandBean} where the action to be taken
 * is determined by the command property
 *
 * This job queue is primarily intended to run solstice (GDA9) scans, however it can be used
 * as a generic way to run jobs with messaging.
