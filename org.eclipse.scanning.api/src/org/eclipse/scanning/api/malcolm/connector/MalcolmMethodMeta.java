/**
 * A class representing a malcolm method and its meta information. An instance of this class

 * as the endpoint. It can be considered to be somewhat like a {@link Method}.
 * <p>
 * Note that this an instance of this class is returned corresponding to both the returned
 * structure "malcolm:core/Method:1.1" structure and the "malcolm:core/MethodMeta:1.1" as
 * we're not interested in the other contents of the Method object, namely the 'took' and
 * 'returned' objects. Additionally, at present we only include the 'defaults' object
 * of the MethodMeta structure (if present), ignoring the 'takes' and 'returns' objects as
 * we currently have no use case for those.
