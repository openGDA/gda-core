/**
 * Interface for models that can be asked to have both their points (non-continuous motion) and bounds (continuous
 * motion, half-distance between points either side) within their region.
 * Therefore, as the number of points in an axis -> 0, the 0th point trends towards the centre of a region,
 * opposed to the non boundsFit behaviour that as number of points -> 0, 0th point remains at the start of the axial model.
 *
 * In the case of Stepped models, this reduces the number of points that can fit into each axis by one (by moving the
 * stepped region half a step in from both edges).
 *
 * In the case of Counted models, this reduces the distance between points, from Length / M to Length / (M - 1):
 * i.e. by a factor of (M - 1) / M in each axis.
 * Where M = Number of points - 1
