/**
 * Interface for Factories that create composites.
 * <p>
 * This interface is intentionally identical to gda.rcp.views.CompositeFactory, in the uk.ac.gda.client plug-in. That
 * one cannot be used by code in the uk.ac.gda.common.rcp plug-in because it would create a cyclic dependency between
 * uk.ac.gda.common.rcp and uk.ac.gda.client. Ideally the classes which really are common should be moved down to the
 * uk.ac.gda.common.rcp plug-in, or perhaps the two plug-ins should just be merged. For now, though, duplicating this
 * interface avoids having to update lots of existing code which uses the version in uk.ac.gda.client.
