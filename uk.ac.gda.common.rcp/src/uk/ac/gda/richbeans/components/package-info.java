 *  These widgets are based on SWT and implement IFieldWidget so that they 
 *  can be used in a RichBeanEditor in the rich bean framework.

 *  Widgets can also be used in RCP developer by using the palate in this
 *  plugin or manually creating your own palate.

 *  2. ComboWrapper - able to show choices to users. Includes a setItems(Map<String,Object>)
 *     which gives the user a visible choice and an XML choice via map.
