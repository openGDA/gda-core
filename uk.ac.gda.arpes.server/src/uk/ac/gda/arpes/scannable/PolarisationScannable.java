/**
 * This is a simple scannable to allow the ID to be moved to a new polarisation, as is the typical requirement of users.
 * The ID currently needs to be moved to a energy and polarisation therefore this scannable uses the PGM to find out the
 * current energy when about to move the ID. This scannable will report busy when ID reports busy. This scannable only
 * implements basic input validation, but if the ID can't deliver the requested setting it will throw causing this
 * device to throw. Currently the valid input values are "LH", "LV", "CR", "CL".
