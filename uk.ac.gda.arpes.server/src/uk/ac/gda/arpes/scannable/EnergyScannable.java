/**
 * This is a simple scannable to allow the PGM and ID to be moved to a new energy, (specified in eV) together, as is the
 * typical requirement of users. This scannable will report busy when either the PGM or ID report busy. This scannable
 * will pass through updates received from the PGM. This scannable does not implement it's own limits but if the ID or
 * PGM can't deliver the requested settings they will throw causing this device to throw.
