/**
 * A interface for a distributed class which runs a Jython script. This class is distributed and IObservable so that GUI
 * object can receive messages back from the running script to inform the user of progress.
 * <p>
 * To run the script, the GUI should run the command returned by the getCommand method using the JythonServerFacade
 * object. The GUI should be set to IObserve this Scriptcontroller, which will then pass messages from the script to its
 * observers via CORBA messaging.
 * <p>
 * It is recommended that the script sends progress messages back to this object's IObserver in the form of
 * gda.jython.scriptcontroller.event classes.
 * <p>
 * If parameters need to be given to the script, a serializable object should be created of the type the script is
 * expecting and placed into the Jython namespace under the name return by this objects getParametersName method. The
 * object is placed into the Jython namespace using the JythonServerFacade object.
 * <p>
 * The import command is the command to run when this object is configured so that the script that this object controls
 * is loaded into the Jython namespace
