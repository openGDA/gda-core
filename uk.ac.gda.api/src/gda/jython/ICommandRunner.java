 * Blocking:      This will not return until the command or script has finished
 *                running. If it takes a long time to run, it will hang the
 *                thread which calls this method, so this it must be called in
 *                a separate thread from the main GUI thread, else the GUI will
 *                seize up until the command has returned.
 * Interruptible: Thread can be interrupted. If the command takes a long time
 *                to run, stopping a scan, script or doing a 'stop all' will
 *                interrupt the thread.
 * Script lock:   Acquire the script lock and run the script, or return BUSY
 *                without running the script, if the lock already has already
 *                been acquired. This allows script locked scripts to ensure
 *                only one will ever be running at once.
