/**
 * Represents possible modes for a camera trigger.
 *
 * <p>
 * The enum value should be not considered directly connected with a camera trigger. The reason relies in the fact
 * that there is not a standard list of trigger consequently is not possible to define a definitive list.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * However is possible to assume at least an <i>INTERNAL</i> and <i>EXTERNAL</i> trigger. The first in particular is useful to configure the camera
 * after acquisition engine, ie Malcolm, left the camera in a status where starting the acquisition is not enough to have a live stream.
 * See {@code @see uk.ac.diamond.daq.client.gui.camera.monitor.widget.CameraMonitorButtonHelper} and {@code CameraProperties.getTriggerMode()}
