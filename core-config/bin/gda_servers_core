# The next section is entered under 3 circumstances:

#    1. If we are in dummy mode and have therefore only been through the 'else' section of the above conditional to start the 
#       server on the same machine as the main gda script was run.
#    2. If we are in live mode and have only been through 'if' section of the above conditional to start the server on the control
#       machine via the ssh tunnel. That is, the ssh tunnel has just been started from the machine the main gda script was run on
#       and this section is executed straight after also on that machine. The script chain started as gda2 on the control machine
#       via the ssh tunnel never comes through here .
#    3. If we are in live mode running the main gda script from the same machine as we expect the gda server to run on not in 
#       remote startup and that machine is the control machine, i.e. "local live" mode operation. In this case, as with case 1.
#       we will only have been through the 'else' section of the conditional
#
# The order of the if statement that grants entry to the section is important as execution can go in if:
#
#    a. We are in dummy mode
#    b. We are NOT in dummy mode (i.e.we are in live) AND we have initilaised the ssh tunnel - normal live beamline operation
#    c. NEITHER a) NOR b) is true AND we are on the control machine AND not in remote startup so live mode and no tunnel - "local live" mode
#
# thus a), b) and c) respectively correspond to 1., 2. and 3.
