	<!-- Standard shared logging configuration used by the GDA server and client. -->

	<!-- In general you should just use this default logging configuration.
		Root logger levels, the Log panel filter level and the LogFile pattern can
		all be configured by properties, so they can be overridden by facility, group
		or beamline config properties. If you really need to customise your logging
		setup beyond this, you should copy this file as a template and keep the "include"
		line below, then override the gda.server.logging.xml property to point to
		your customised configuration file. -->
