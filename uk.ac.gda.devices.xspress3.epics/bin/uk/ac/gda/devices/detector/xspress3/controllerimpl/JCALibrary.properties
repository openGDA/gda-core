#Beamline network
#================
#	addr_list must point to the broadcast address of the specific beamline
#		Sometimes you may need to add other addresses for PV not exposed directly 
#		on the beamline network.
#	server_port must be set to 5064
#	repeater_port must be set to 5065
#
#EPICS Simulation
#================
#	addr_list must point to 172.23.7.113 (dasc-epics.sc.diamond.ac.uk in Data Acquisition Lab)
#		but the officenet broadcast address *.255 below works as well
#       for control that is 172.23.244.9
#	server_port must be set to 6064
#	repeater_port must be set to 6065 
#
#NOTE: you must use IP address, not domain name as CAJ is currently not DNS-aware. 
#



# beamline settings
# point to I20-ws001 during development
