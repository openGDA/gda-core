This document briefly explains how to add a new element to an interface and regenerate the model for it.

Let's say we wanted to add an element called "name" to the interface "uk.ac.gda.excalibur.config.model.ExcaliburConfig" 
1. Add a setter and getter to the interface. 
2. Annotate the getter (getName()) with @model and the method will look as below
    /**
	 * @model
	 */
	String getName();
3. Do not annotate the setter so the setter remains
     void setName(String name);
4. Right click on the "excaliburConfig.genmodel" file inside the "model" folder and click on "Reload"
5. This will open a wizard 
	Select "Annotated Java" and click Next
	Enable the checkbox "uk.ac.gda.excalibur.config.model" package (this should have already been selected)
	and press "Finish"
5. Open the file in the "EMF Generator" editor and right click on the root node which is called "ExcaliburConfig" and do 
   Generate Model Code
   Generate Edit Code
   Generate Editor Code
   
This will generate the necessary java methods in its implementation and will provide a handle for emf command executions.
