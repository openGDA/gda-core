 * This is a wrapper loader around the ClassLoader for this class which (under Equinox) is the

 * allowing it to load exported classes from any plugin.
 *
 * There is optionally an additional loader involved which allows for the case where a library might
 * need to load its own internal (non exported) classes in addition to other classes.
 *
 * Note that this ClassLoader isn't really responsible for loading anything itself but rather to provide
 * an access point to OSGi dynamic imports, that is to say that for each Class object returned, the classloader
 * field will be the EquinoxClassLoader assosicated with the classes containing plugin.
