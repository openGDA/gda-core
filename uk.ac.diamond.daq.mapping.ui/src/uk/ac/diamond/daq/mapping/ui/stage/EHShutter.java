 * A default object to retrieve a beam selector scannable through the {@link ScannablesPropertiesHelper#getManagedScannable(String, String, Class)}

 * A beam selector is an object which can select a special type of beam (by energy, by size or other) either through a filter or a mechanical device.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * A widget can use its own implementation to use a scannable, however object like this should help to both have a more parametrise
 * client and reduce the multiplication of different groupID and scannableID.
