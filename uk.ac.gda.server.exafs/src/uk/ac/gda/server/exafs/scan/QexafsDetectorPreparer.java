 * For QEXAFS, override the detectors listed in the XML file to remove the need to have two detector XML files.

 * The normal paradigm for the XAS Experiment perspective is that the same XML files can be used for all scan types,
 * with only the scan XML file changing. But this breaks down for qexafs where different detector objects are needed as
 * they need to fulfil the BufferedDetector interface. So instead override the list of detectors using the DetectorPreparer.
