/**
 * This Collection strategy can be used where the detector acquisition is started and stopped in EPICS, such as zacscan in I06.
 *
 * Since this collection strategy lets EPICS to control detector start and stop, the status of the detector should always return IDEL, and
 * the waitWhileBusy should do nothing, so GDA scan will not wait for this detector.
 *
 * This strategy can be used in place of {@link SoftwareStartStop} to give control of the camera to EPICS.
