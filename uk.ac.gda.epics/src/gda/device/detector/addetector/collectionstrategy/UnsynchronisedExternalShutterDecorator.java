	 * Override decorated class in order to silently extend detector acquisition time.
	 * 
	 * On beamlines where an external shutter is used to control the length of an exposure and the trigger/gate for the shutter
	 * is not also sent to the detector, the acquisition must enclose the shutter acquisition time. Thus the actual acquisition
	 * needs to be the requested acquisition time, plus the time of the longest possible run-up.
	 * 
	 * Since the actual time of the run-up is variable, based on the target speed and timeToVelocity of the motor, and some
	 * detectors need a constant acquire time (PE needs a new dark to be taken every time the acquire time changes for instance)
	 * for the moment we have to use a single fixed time for the triggering strategy.
	 * 
	 * Note, the collectionExtensionTimeS value should be as short as possible to prevent unnecessary delays.
