 * This class is intended as the base class for all Area Detector Collection strategies which are compatible with the new composition system. Currently it just
 * redirects to AbstractADTriggeringStrategy, but eventually it should replace it, with a minimal set of collection strategy functions, allowing
 * AbstractADCollectionStrategyDecorators to add most of the more complex code. Any functions that just delegate to AbstractADTriggeringStrategy should be added
 * to AbstractADCollectionStrategyBase, not to this class.
