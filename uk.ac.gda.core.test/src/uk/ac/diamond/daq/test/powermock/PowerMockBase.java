 * <p>
 * It should have been sufficient to only use {@link ClassPathAdjuster}

 * PowerMock persists in some form between tests in the same OSGi runtime

 * The alternative mechanism is PowerMock's {@link PowerMockIgnore} but this
 * faces similar state issues with the specific class being mocked by one
 * of the tests in this plugin.
