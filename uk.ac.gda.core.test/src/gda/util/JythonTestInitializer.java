/**
 * This is an OSGi DS component which allows the static state of Jython
 * (as represented by PySystemState's initialized field) to be configured early
 * in the life of the JVM so that tests may run in any order.
 * <p>
 * This is becuase some tests will indirectly cause Jython to be initalized whilst
 * others require specific initialization properties to be applied.
 * <p>
 * In this case a sufficient setup is provided by the solstice scanning {@link JythonInterpreterManager}
 * <p>
 * This is registered via its DS xml file under the OSGI-INF directory. Note that fragent bundles
 * (such as uk.ac.gda.core.test) cannot contain Service-Component manifest headers
 * so this works by the fact that the host bundle (uk.ac.gda.core) contains the header:
 * {@code Service-Component:OSGI-INF/*.xml}
