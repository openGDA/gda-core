 * <p>A custom {@link Answer} that collects the argument of the method it is used for.
 * This answer only currently works with methods that take a single argument.
 * This class uses a supplied copy function to clone the argument, so that
 * we can verify the argument as it was when the method was called, not when
 * we do the verification.</p>
 *
 * <p>Note: it would have been nice to create something like {@link ArgumentCaptor}
 * (probably by extending it) that works exactly the same as that, but also
 * copying the argument, but this was not possible as it would require using internal
 * package of the mockito plug-in jar.</p>
