 * Event for broadcast by Scriptcontrollers to inform IObervers of the script that a scan has been created by the
 * script, so ScanDataPoints with a matching scan name may be expected.
 * <p>
 * Observers of the script, via the Scriptcontroller, should also observer the JythonServer to receive the relevant
 * ScanDataPoints.
 * <p>
 * Example usage in a Jython script:
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * controller = Finder.find("MyScriptObserver")
 * controller.update(None,ScriptProgressEvent("Running scan"))
 * thisscan = ConcurrentScan(scan_args)
 * controller.update(None,ScanCreationEvent(thisscan.getName()))
 * thisscan.runScan()
 * controller.update(None,ScanFinishEvent(thisscan.getName(),ScanFinishEvent.FinishType.OK));
