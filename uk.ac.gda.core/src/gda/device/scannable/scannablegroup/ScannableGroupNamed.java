/**
 * A logical group of Scannables that allows multiple Scannables to be moved at the same time, or allows further
 * validation for movement, e.g. {@link MotomanRobotScannableGroup}'s validation on simultaneous KTheta, KPhi movement,
 * that can additionally be managed through the Finder.
 *
 * inputNames, extraNames and outputFormat are taken from the constituent Scannables, not maintained as a field of the
 * Group.
 *
 * A ScannableGroupNamed is a logical group of Scannables that can be created through Spring instantiation or by adding
 * Scannables from the Jython console, or through the use of Scannable names with the Finder.
 *
 * Configuring a ScannableGroup configures all of its component Scannables and adds itself as an IObserver, and the
 * default behaviour of adding a Scannable to an already configured ScannableGroup is to configure the Scannable
 * (although it can instead un-configure the group, allowing it to be configured again).
 *
 * ScannableGroups can add, remove or set Scannables by using the Scannables or their names, and additionally can remove
 * Scannables by their index.
 *
 * The names within a ScannableGroupNamed are simply taken from the Scannables, not maintained seperately. For a more
 * lightweight Name/Scannable group management object, see AssemblyBase, which maintains Scannables and Names
 * seperately until configured.
