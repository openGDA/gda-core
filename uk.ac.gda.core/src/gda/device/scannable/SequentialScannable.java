/**
 * This class extends {@link CoupledScannable}, but it moves the component scannables in sequence rather than
 * simultaneously.
 * <p>
 * It was written to handle the specific requirements of I08-1, which had two devices that needed to be moved in equal
 * and opposite directions in sequence: see https://jira.diamond.ac.uk/browse/I08-317.<br>
 * However, it is written to be configurable for different types of sequential motion.
 * <p>
 * The SequentialScannable object, like {@link CoupledScannable}, is initialised with a list of scannables and functions
 * that control their relative motion.<br>
 * Additionally, you can specify the order in which the scannables should be moved:
 * <ul>
 * <li>ALWAYS_FORWARDS (default): always move the scannables in the order they are specified in the list</li>
 * <li>WITH_MOVEMENT: if the "primary" scannable (the first in the list) is to be moved in a positive direction, iterate
 * forwards over the list to move the scannables (i.e. move them in the order in which they are specified in the list);
 * if the primary scannable is moved in a negative direction, iterate backwards over the list</li>
 * <li>CONTRARY_TO_MOVEMENT: if the primary scannable is moved in a positive direction, iterate backwards over the list
 * of scannables: if it is moved in a negative direction, iterate forwards over the list</li>
