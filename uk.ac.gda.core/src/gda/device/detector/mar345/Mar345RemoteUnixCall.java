/**
 * The mar software runs on a server/workstation connected directly to the mar detector and the GDA client and server
 * will be running on different machines. The MAR will be operated by using the scan345 command which reads commands
 * from mar.com and writes messages to mar.message so we need to be able to start and the scan345 command on the mar
 * server. We don't have to worry about writing and reading mar.com and mar.message because the mar directory is nfs
 * mounted onto the GDA server or client machine. (At Diamond the MAR software is located in /dls_sw/apps/i15/mar) To
 * operate the scan345 we will run bash scripts which will remotely execute or stop scan345 via ssh. 2
