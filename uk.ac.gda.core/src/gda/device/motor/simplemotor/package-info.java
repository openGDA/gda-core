/**
 * SimpleMotor is a package of classes to make the creation of a GDA gda.device.Motor class
 * for a particular motor controller by simply implementing SimpleMotorController
 * 
 * SimpleMotor - implements Motor and uses SimpleMotorController
 * 
 * A simple motor is one that has not speed adjustment and has no intrinsic limits
 * 
 * If there is 1 controller for multiple axes use SimpleMotorViaIndexedController as controller for each SimpleMotor
 * and that uses a SimpleIndexedMotorController that you need to create.
