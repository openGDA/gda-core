"""
A friendly interface to mapping scans.

Basic Syntax is of the form:

mscan [<axes> <RegionShape> <RegionShape Params>]* [<Scanpath> <Scanpath Params>]^ <Detectors/Monitors>

* When defining a Static/Acquire scan, these arguments should be excluded
^ When defining a Static/Acquire scan, these arguments are optional (unless requiring multiple exposures)

where:

<axes> can be two Scannables or two element ScannableGroup
<RegionShape> can be rect (rectangle)
             crec (centred_rectangle)
             circ (circle)
             poly (polygon)
             line (line) -- a line in 2D space
             poin (point)
             axis (axial) -- a line along a scannable axis
    N.B. the full name or abbreviation can be used
<RegionShape Params> are the numeric parameters for the specified RegionShape
<Scanpath> can be grid (grid_points)
                      rast (raster/grid_step)
                      spir (spiral)
                      liss (lissajous)
                      step (line_step)
                      nopt (line_points)
                      poin (point)
                      axst (axis_step)
                      axno (axis_points)
                      stat (static/acquire) [a scan in which no motors are moved, only exposures taken]
    N.B. the full name or abbreviation can be used, other aliases are also provided see below)
    
    In order to try to be consistent and standardised and move away from poorly chose pathnames
    link raster (which actually means step along each axis) and grid (which actually means no
    of points along each axis) the line_step and line_points paths can be used for the axis roi
    and for the rectangular, circular and polygonal rois. So the following a valid:
    
    mscan S1 axis 0 10 step 1...             (an axis_step scan along the S1 axis with step size 1)
    mscan S1 axis 0 10 pts 10...             (an axis_points scan along the S1 axis with 10 points)
    mscan S1 S2 rect 0,0 1,1 step 0.1 0.2... (a 'raster' scan in S1 and S2 with step sizes of 0.1 and 0.2 along S1 and S2)
    mscan S1 S2 circ 0,0 1 pts 10 11...      (a 'grid' scan (inside a circle) in S1 and S2 with a max of 10 points along 
                                              S1 and 11 along S2) 
    
<Scanpath Params> are the numeric parameters for the specified Scanpath
<Detectors/Monitors> are a list of Detectors, Monitors or IRunnableDevices

N.B. At the moment IRunnableDevice detectors are not supported natively and must
have an accompanying Scannable based Detector in the beamline config with a
matching name to be used.

The default RegionShape and Scanpath are rectangle and raster and these will be
selected if none are specified in the command e.g.

mscan sc1 sc2 0,0 5,5 0.5,0.5 d1

is the same as

mscan sc1 sc2 rect 0,0 5,5 rast 0.5,0.5 d1

commas are not required but may be added between axis params to improve 
readability.

If no non-detector Scannables are passed, and the default Scanpath is instead a Static scan with a single exposure, 
e.g.

mscan det <det_params>
mscan static det <det_params>
mscan static 1 det <det params>

are all the same. 

mscan static <size> det <det_params> 

Would take <size> exposures with det, and requires calling the static scanpath explicitly.

To enable the functionality:
1. Make sure any references to importing "mapping_scan_commands.py" are removed
from your localstation.py or any other scripts
2. Add the line "from gdascripts.mscanHandler import *" to your localstation.py
3. Start the GDA server or run reset_namespace if it's already active.
